Factory patterns


University app needs to create study plans for different programs.
Program for IT -student is 1. introductory, 2. front-end dev and 3. final thesis
Program for Business student is 1. introductory, 2. online-marketing, 3. invoicing and 4. final thesis

Create objects to represent the programs.

Client app can then use the programs to perform tasks:

itCourse.listIntroductoryCourses();  //Console.WriteLine("listing all IT-program introductory courses.")
businessCourse.listOnlineMarketingCourses();  //Console.WriteLine("listing all Business-program online marketing courses.")
